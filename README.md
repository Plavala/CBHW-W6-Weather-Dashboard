# CBHW-W6-Weather-Dashboard
Create weather forecaster using Open-Weather one call API 

## Description
For our sixth homework. We were asked to create a simple weather dashboard using bootstrap and jquery alongside script, html and css. Lucky for us the teacher helped us along the way and we were all able to get the sites to work mostly. If you type in a city it should show the weather and further details for the selected location for the next five days. 

*Here is an example of what that page should closely like.*
